# Computational Intelligence Toolkit
Implemented the meta-heuristic algorithms and developed a learning toolkit using Java. The user can compare different algorithms and has the option to visualize the algorithms' performance using JFreeCharts and JFreeCommons. In the toolkit, the following algorithms have been implemented:
1. Particle Swarm Optimization
2. Artificial Immune System
3. Evolutionary Algorithms
4. Evolutionary Programming
5. Evolutionary Strategies
6. Firefly Algorithm
7. BrainStorm Optimization
8. Gravitational Search Algorithm
9. Immune Gravitational Inspired Optimization Algorithm
10. Neural Networks

The algorithms can be compared using four different functions:
1. Rosenbrock Function
2. Rastrigin Function
3. Six-hump Function
4. Himmelblau's Function
